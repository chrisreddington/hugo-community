# Contributing to Community, a Hugo Theme
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions will be understood under the same [MIT License](https://github.com/chrisreddington/hugo-community/blob/main/LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

### We require a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)
What is a DCO? As explained over at [GitHub's probot site](https://probot.github.io/apps/dco/), the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing to the project. Contributors sign-off that they adhere to these requirements by adding a Signed-off-by line to commit messages.

The DCO (copied below for convenience, can be found at [https://developercertificate.org/](https://developercertificate.org/).

```
Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the
    best of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open
    source license and I have the right under that license to   
    submit that work with modifications, whether created in whole
    or in part by me, under the same open source license (unless
    I am permitted to submit under a different license), as
    Indicated in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including
    all personal information I submit with it, including my
    sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed
    consistent with this project or the open source license(s)
    involved.
```

We have added a GitHub application to automatically check that a DCO is present on commits which are made into the repository. To have a Pull Request merged into the repository, you **must** complete this. Don't worry if you forgot in advance! The GitHub Checks experience will flag the DCO failure, and provide steps to help you remediate that!

## Report bugs or request features using Github's [issues](https://github.com/chrisreddington/hugo-community/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/chrisreddington/hugo-community/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports and feature requests with detail, background, and sample code

The GitHub repository have Issues Templates set up, so that you have a quick and easy template to get going to make a detailed feature request or bug report. Please do take the few minutes of time to complete this, it really does help!

**Great issues** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- If a bug - 
  - Steps to reproduce
    - Be specific!
    - Give sample code if you can. 
  - What you expected would happen
  - What actually happens
  - Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
- If a feature request - 
  - Context - Why is this feature important to you? It helps us prioritise!
  - Possible implementation - Do you have some sample code / references to share? It could help encourage someone to contribute quickly!
  - Notes - Any additional details that you think are relevant, e.g. Browser/OS details if it's some kind of UI driven request.


## Use a Consistent Coding Style
I'm again borrowing these from [Facebook's Guidelines](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/blob/a9316a723f9e918afde44dea68b5f9f39b7d9b00/CONTRIBUTING.md)

* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* You should consider linting the codebase prior to a Pull Request. All of our PRs go through [GitHub's superlinter](https://github.com/github/super-linter). (WIP - Not yet in place)
