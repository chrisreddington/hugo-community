# Contributing to Community, a Hugo Theme
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions will be understood under the same [MIT License](https://github.com/chrisreddington/hugo-community/blob/main/LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs or request features using Github's [issues](https://github.com/chrisreddington/hugo-community/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/chrisreddington/hugo-community/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports and feature requests with detail, background, and sample code

The GitHub repository have Issues Templates set up, so that you have a quick and easy template to get going to make a detailed feature request or bug report. Please do take the few minutes of time to complete this, it really does help!

**Great issues** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- If a bug - 
  - Steps to reproduce
    - Be specific!
    - Give sample code if you can. 
  - What you expected would happen
  - What actually happens
  - Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
- If a feature request - 
  - Context - Why is this feature important to you? It helps us prioritise!
  - Possible implementation - Do you have some sample code / references to share? It could help encourage someone to contribute quickly!
  - Notes - Any additional details that you think are relevant, e.g. Browser/OS details if it's some kind of UI driven request.


## Use a Consistent Coding Style
I'm again borrowing these from [Facebook's Guidelines](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/blob/a9316a723f9e918afde44dea68b5f9f39b7d9b00/CONTRIBUTING.md)

* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* You should consider linting the codebase prior to a Pull Request. All of our PRs go through [GitHub's superlinter](https://github.com/github/super-linter). (WIP - Not yet in place)
