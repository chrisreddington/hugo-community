# Community, a Hugo Theme

Community is a hugo theme intended for small community and meetup groups to easily get going. The theme is heavily driven around the concept of events and speakers, and would be well-suited to conferences, or groups that hold talks.

## Example

You can find an example at [https://chrisreddington.github.io/hugo-community/](https://chrisreddington.github.io/hugo-community/).

## Installation

This theme is currently a work in development, and I have not yet prioritised installation instructions. If you are interested, please get in touch.

## Usage
For further details on how to configure the theme and gain the most value from it, please view the [Reference](REFERENCE.md).

## Contributing

This theme is currently a work in development, and I have not yet prioritised contribution instructions. If you are interested in lending a hand, please get in touch.

## Support

I've created this theme as a way of giving back to the community, recognising that I am likely not the only one to be solving this particular problem.

I am looking to get more involved in the community. I'm not looking for any sponsorship for this project, but would greatly value additional follows/likes/subscriptions on my [Personal Twitter](https://twitter.com/reddobowen), [Podcast Twitter](https://twitter.com/cloudwithchris) and [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/CloudWithChris).
