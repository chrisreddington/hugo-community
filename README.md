# Community, a Hugo Theme

Community is a hugo theme intended for small community and meetup groups to easily get going. The theme is heavily driven around the concept of events and speakers, and would be well-suited to conferences, or groups that hold talks.

## Example Sites

There are four example configurations of this theme, which you can find demo sites of below - 

* A "Conference Event without Groups" Configuration at [https://hugo-community-conference.netlify.app/](https://hugo-community-conference.netlify.app/) (AKA, Single Event, Single Group)
* A "Conference Event with Groups" Configuration [https://hugo-community-conference-groups.netlify.app/](https://hugo-community-conference-groups.netlify.app/) (AKA Single Event, Multi Group)
* A "Community Group" Configuration [https://hugo-community-group.netlify.app/](https://hugo-community-group.netlify.app/) (AKA Many Event, Single Group)
* A "Community Groups Platform" Configuration [https://hugo-community-platform.netlify.app/](https://hugo-community-platform.netlify.app/) (AKA Many Event, Single Group)

You can find an example at [https://hugo-community.netlify.app//](https://hugo-community.netlify.app/).

This theme is currently a work in development, and I have not yet prioritised contribution instructions. If you are interested in lending a hand, please get in touch.

## Support

I've created this theme as a way of giving back to the community, recognising that I am likely not the only one to be solving this particular problem.

I am looking to get more involved in the community. I'm not looking for any sponsorship for this project, but would greatly value additional follows/likes/subscriptions on my [Personal Twitter](https://twitter.com/reddobowen), [Podcast Twitter](https://twitter.com/cloudwithchris) and [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/CloudWithChris).
