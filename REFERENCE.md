### Site Required Settings

There are certain require "base elemenets" for the theme. These include a number of taxonomies, as well as the generation of a manifest.json file, which is used for the Progressive Web App functionality of the theme.

You can safely add additional taxonomies to the theme if you wish, but please do not remove the existing ones that are in place.

### Privacy Settings

There are a number of configuration settings built-in to Hugo to help meet Privacy / Data Protection Regulations. The configuration shown is an example configuration. You should make your own decisions on what privacy settings are required, using the [Hugo and the GEneral Data Protection Regulation Documentation](https://gohugo.io/about/hugo-and-gdpr/).

## Archetypes

Archetypes are a concept within Hugo. They are templates which can be easily used when you want to create new content. You can find more about Archetypes in Hugo [here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/).

The Community theme leverages a number of archetypes to deliver the site's content. Please refer to the information below on how to use archetypes, so that you can add additional content to your site.

### Community

To create a new community resource, use the following command in your site folder

```
hugo new community/community-item.md
```

**Note:** Be aware of the different syntax between events/groups and community/speakers. The community example does not require the --kind parameter, as it is a single page, rather than a bundle. This is also why we need to specify the .md extension, to represent that we wish to create a markdown file.

### Event

To create a new event, use the following command in your site folder

```
hugo new --kind event event/your-intended-directory-name
```

The event archetype contains a bundle of files, including - 
* The _index.md file which contains information about the event itself.
* A subfolder called activities, which can contain many files. These files represent individual sessions/talks/etc. To create more activities, just copy/paste the files in the activities subfolder.
* A subfolder called sponsors, which can contain many files. These files represent sponsors of this particular event. To create more sponsors, just copy/paste the files in the organizers subfolder.

| activities_name | No       | Used as an override of the name that describes the activities associated.

| group           | No       | The URLized version of the group (The folder name). This is used, so that the group that is associated with the event can be displayed on the event. Additionally, the event will also be available on the group's page. This is optional, and not really required in a "Single Group" configuration of the site, but is particularly useful in a "Multi Group" configuration for a cohesive experience.                                                               | meetup-group-london                                                |
| lastMod         | No       | Datetime that the file was last modified. This is not necessary if you are storing the source in a Git Repository and have the enableGitInfo parameter set in Site Configuration. In that scenario, hugo will set the last modified value of the page to the last commit in Version Control. Otherwise, if you have enable_last_updated set to true, and are not using Git/enableGitInfo, then you will need to set the lastMod property manually in your frontmatter. | 2020-12-01T10:00:00Z                                               |

### Group


To create a new group, use the following command in your site folder

```
hugo new --kind group group/your-intended-directory-name
```

The group archetype contains a bundle of files, including - 
* The _index.md file which contains information about the group itself.
* Several additional optional markdown files in the **your-intended-directory-name** folder. These can be shown using the tabbed interface of the Group page. Do take note of the frontmatter that drives this functionality.

#### Single Group Sites

Additional information, TBC

#### Multi Group Sites

Additional information, TBC

### Speaker

To create a new group, use the following command in your site folder

```
hugo new speaker/speaker-name.md
```

**Note:** Be aware of the different syntax between events/groups and community/speakers. The community example does not require the --kind parameter, as it is a single page, rather than a bundle. This is also why we need to specify the .md extension, to represent that we wish to create a markdown file.

Otherwise, if you have enable_last_updated set to true, and are not using Git/enableGitInfo, then you will need to set the lastMod property manually in your frontmatter. | 2020-12-01T10:00:00Z                              |
